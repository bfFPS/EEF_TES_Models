DONE For the competitor analysis:
    create a new table that populates with a tick or no-tick for each company across some
    services

DONE 1) do the cost analysis to find the required PCM capacity for 4-year turnover
    go back to Michael's email to find the info for the cost analysis

DONE 2) run yearly analysis with the proper 48-timesteps SOC carry-over constraint
    -- can do a sensitivity analysis on the influence of carry-over period (instead of 48 tsteps,
    maybe monthly)
    !! Cannot run sensitivity analysis on bunches bigger than 48, gets too complicated
    because bunch size must be divisor of s

DONE 3) do Henry's temperature-map visualisations for the schedule
    and for yearly

DONE 2a) implement the self-discharge
    remember to only put the extra term in the lower bound, the upper bound is the same
    
4) document all I have done

5) make a quick Particle Swarm Optimization script to solve the same problem, just to get it 
    up and running, and also to have a couple different methods to follow
