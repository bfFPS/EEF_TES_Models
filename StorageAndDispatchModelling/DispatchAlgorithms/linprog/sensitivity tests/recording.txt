Monthly recordings for yearly analysis. The maximum discharge 
rate for each iteration in the analysis is calculated using 
interpolation of the temperature-dependent data points provided.

it is important to note that for any temperature below 5 Celsius, 
the maximum discharge power is set at 0 kW -- the PCM cannot 
discharge.
